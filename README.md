# Assessment-of-CRM-for-dose-escalation-phase-I-oncology-clin
Worked on the continual reassessment method (CRM) whih identifies the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) more efficiently and identifies the true MTD more frequently compared to standard methods such as the 3 + 3 method. For every true dose-toxicity relationship, the CRM selected the MTD that matched the true MTD in a higher proportion of studies compared to the 3 + 3 method. The CRM overestimated the MTD in a higher proportion of simulations compared to the 3 + 3 method.

Worked with a sample of 100 patients who already have cancer symptoms aging between 18 and 65.The data I worked with had a prior of estimated probablities of the DLT.
